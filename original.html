      <h1 id="origin-title">The tortoise and the Hare</h1>
      <article id="origin-story">
        <p>A hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow.</p>

        <p>"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.</p>

        <p>
          "Yes," replied the Tortoise, "and I get there sooner than you think.
          I'll run you a race and prove it."
        </p>

        <p>
          The hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the
          Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the Fox, who had
          consented to act as judge, marked the distance and starded the runners
          off.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very
          deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay
          down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch
          up.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Tortoise meanwhile kep going slowly but steadily, and, after a
          time, passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept
          on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise was
          near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not
          overtake the Tortoise in time.
